# Man versus Machine Learning Replication
Replication of tables and figures from "Man versus Machine Learning: The term Structure of Earnings Expectations and Conditional Biases in Stata, R and Python.

Abstract:

We introduce a real-time measure of conditional biases to firms’ earnings forecasts. The measure is defined as the difference between analysts’ expectations and a statistically optimal unbiased machine-learning benchmark. Analysts’ conditional expectations are, on average, biased upward, a bias that increases in the forecast horizon. These biases are associated with negative cross-sectional return predictability, and the short legs of many anomalies contain firms with excessively optimistic earnings forecasts. Further, managers of companies with the greatest upward-biased earnings forecasts are more likely to issue stocks. Commonly used linear earnings models do not work out-of-sample and are inferior to those analysts provide.
